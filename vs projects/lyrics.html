        Do you recall, not long ago
        We would walk on the sidewalk?
        Innocent, remember?
        All we did was care for each other
        But the night was warm
        We were bold and young
        All around, the wind blows
        We would only hold on to let go
        Blow a kiss, fire a gun
        We need someone to lean on
        Blow a kiss, fire a gun
        All we need is somebody to lean on
        Blow a kiss, fire a gun
        We need someone to lean on
        Blow a kiss, fire a gun
        A-A-All we need is somebody to lean on
        What will we do when we get old?
        Will we walk down the same road?
        Will you be there by my side?
        Standin' strong as the waves roll over
        When the nights are long
        Longing for you to come home
        All around, the wind blows
        We would only hold on to let go
        Blow a kiss, fire a gun
        We need someone to lean on
        Blow a kiss, fire a gun
        All we need is somebody to lean on (hey)
        Blow a kiss, fire a gun
        We need someone to lean on
        Blow a kiss, fire a gun
        A-A-All we need is somebody to lean on
        All we need is somebody to lean on
        (We need someone to lean on, hey)
        (Hey, hey)
        A-A-All we need is somebody to lean on
        (Major Lazer, hey)
        Oh, oh-oh
        (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
        (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
        Blow a kiss, fire a gun (hey, hey)
        We need someone to lean on (hey, hey)
        Blow a kiss, fire a gun (hey, hey)
        All we need is somebody to lean on (hey, hey)
        Blow a kiss, fire a gun (hey, hey)
        We need someone to lean on (hey, hey)
        Blow a kiss, fire a gun (hey, hey)
        A-A-All we need is somebody to lean on (hey, hey)
